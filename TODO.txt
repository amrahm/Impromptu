Input Transparent seems to disable all touch on iOS. Maybe try going back to disabling scrolling? Try on just iOS first.

Have things get larger as they approach the top of the screen when scrolling.

Use contractions (e.g. hrs instead of hours) before resizing, and also then remove unnecessary words (e.g. "left").

OMG when you swipe up make the tiles stack behind each other maybe? Or compress until they are real close and then they leave the page?
