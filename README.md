**Impromptu** is a productivity app for students who have trouble managing their time. Students often struggle with planning their work when unexpected setbacks disrupt their schedule, which leaves them to re-plan or give up. To solve this, Impromptu automates the bulk of the planning process by using their deadlines to suggest how long they should work on their various assignments in the coming days. This way students always know when to work on what, alleviating them from the stress of planning and replanning and ensuring that they finish with time to spare. By making replanning their entire schedule only take a few taps and no thinking, Impromptu will help students maintain a plan for their work even with constant unexpected delays.
